This repo is where I practice projects related to R Studio with the topics as below:

1. **Perform EDA ON COVID-19 dataset**
- Import data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
- Get familiar with some basic command from *data.table, funModeling, Hmisc, and ggplot2 libraries*
- Check for null values, data types, etc
- Perform statistics summary
- Visualize dataset
